# K40-Whisperer

This fork ports the K40-Whisperer to Python 3 and adds remote control.

The Windows executables are created by executing the build_exe.bat

To control the laser remotely, setup the server.dat file and run the server.py on the computer connected to the laser, run the k40whisperer.exe and select the network laser device.

The program was tested with a Windows client and the server running on a RaspberryPi with Raspbian.
